          DXC Global Data Management helps ensure transparency and consistency
          when working with business data across your organization, while still
          allowing for the requirements of individual companies.
        </h3>
        <p>
          So you have the visibility, control and flexibility you need to be
          agile, without sacrificing data integrity.

          <p>
            Managing data in a uniform way across your entire organization can
            improve operational efficiency and business insight. But when you
            have local subsidiaries or locations with unique requirements, it
            can be difficult to control and use data in a uniform and efficient
            way. <br />DXC Global Data Management works seamlessly with
            Microsoft Dynamics 365, so that you can take a one-company approach
            to data governance. The generic interface allows you to replicate
            data across companies in your ERP installation and to determine
            centrally which information, settings, values and fields can be
            created, modified and deleted by local companies ‒ so you stay in
            full control of your critical global business data.<br /><br />
            With DXC Global Data Management, you can:

          <p>
            With DXC Global Data Management, you can define a single Global Data
            Account that acts as a data warehouse for all the master data that
            you want to replicate to other companies and locations in your
            organization. <br /><br />These companies can be added to Company
            Groups that are connected to one or more records in the Global Data
            Account.<br /><br />
            Once a company is added to a Company Group, you can synchronize
            these specific records – including master data, reference data and
            parameters – with that company using a number of push and pull
            distribution methods.<br />
            You can also create new companies that will be populated with a
            specific set of base data from the Global Data Account when you add
            them to an existing company group.

          <p>
            With DXC Global Data Management, you have full control over how and
            when data is distributed. Global data can be pushed to subsidiaries
            when needed, or sent via batch jobs during off hours to optimise
            your system performance.

          <p>
            In addition to defining which data each of your companies or local
            subsidiaries can see, you can also control what they can do with the
            data locally, based on their company type and business focus.
            <br /><br />For example, you can define that local manufacturing
            companies get only production- related data and local sales
            companies receive only sales-related items.<br /><br />
            For each company, you can define which information, settings, values
            and fields they can see, which they can define or modify, and which
            they can delete.<br /><br />
            This allows local companies to make the necessary modifications they
            need to meet local requirements, while still ensuring transparency,
            consistency and governance when working with business data across
            your organization.<br /><br />
            Local organizations can, for example, implement relevant VAT
            set-ups, or define specific payment- and delivery-terms.

            <li>Add a new table to the Global Data Management set-up</li>
            <li>
              Define where the data in the table is maintained, and if local
              entities can create new records, or edit existing records, in the
              global data account
            </li>
            <li>
              Define settings for global and local deletion – with options
              ranging from denial of deletion to a full cascade deletion in all
              companies
