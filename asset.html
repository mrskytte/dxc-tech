        <h3 id="summary">
          DXC Global Data Management helps ensure transparency and consistency
          when working with business data across your organization, while still
          allowing for the requirements of individual companies.
        </h3>
        <p>
          So you have the visibility, control and flexibility you need to be
          agile, without sacrificing data integrity.

        <section id="section1">
          <h2 class="sectiontitle">Overview</h2>
          <p>
            Managing data in a uniform way across your entire organization can
            improve operational efficiency and business insight. But when you
            have local subsidiaries or locations with unique requirements, it
            can be difficult to control and use data in a uniform and efficient
            way. <br />DXC Global Data Management works seamlessly with
            Microsoft Dynamics 365, so that you can take a one-company approach
            to data governance. The generic interface allows you to replicate
            data across companies in your ERP installation and to determine
            centrally which information, settings, values and fields can be
            created, modified and deleted by local companies ‒ so you stay in
            full control of your critical global business data.<br /><br />
            With DXC Global Data Management, you can:

          <h2 class="sectiontitle">Simple set up and use</h2>
          <p>
            With DXC Global Data Management, you can define a single Global Data
            Account that acts as a data warehouse for all the master data that
            you want to replicate to other companies and locations in your
            organization. These companies can be added to Company Groups that
            are connected to one or more records in the Global Data Account.
            Once a company is added to a Company Group, you can synchronize
            these specific records – including master data, reference data and
            parameters – with that company using a number of push and pull
            distribution methods.

        <section id="section3">
          <h2 class="sectiontitle">Flexible data distribution methods</h2>
          <p>
            With DXC Global Data Management, you have full control over how and
            when data is distributed. Global data can be pushed to subsidiaries
            when needed, or sent via batch jobs during off hours to optimise
            your system performance.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="section4">
          <h2 class="sectiontitle">Structured data access and rights</h2>
          <p>
            In addition to defining which data each of your companies or local
            subsidiaries can see, you can also control what they can do with the
            data locally, based on their company type and business focus. For
            example, you can define that local manufacturing companies get only
            production- related data and local sales companies receive only
            sales-related items. For each company, you can define which
            information, settings, values and fields they can see, which they
            can define or modify, and which they can delete. This allows local
            companies to make the necessary modifications they need to meet
            local requirements, while still ensuring transparency, consistency
            and governance when working with business data across your
            organization. Local organizations can, for example, implement
            relevant VAT set-ups, or define specific payment- and
            delivery-terms.

          <h2 class="sectiontitle">Flexible set-up options</h2>
          <p>
            You can set up the whole solution from a single management form that
            consist of three Fast Tabs for setting up tables, setting up fields,
            and defining relationships between tables.

          <p>
            Daily users in local companies have access to the solution through
            the ribbon on list pages or detail pages of forms that are selected
            in the Global Data Management table. From this ribbon, they can
            select single or multiple records and push or pull data between
            selected companies. They can also create new data records or edit
            existing global data records if this is allowed in the Global Data
            Management setup.

            You can export your current Global Data Management configuration as
            an XML file. This can then be used for backup purposes, or for
            importing into other systems.

            The solution allows you to get a full overview of the current Global
            Data Management set-up for all your companies. You can see which
            tables have been set up for a selected company and see details of
            the selection set-up for each table.
